/* Wrap element in div
The JavaScript code below installs en eventListener on a variable btn. A button element that is a descendent of another element with id wrapper was assigned to the variable btn. But, the existing button element has no parent node with id wrapper.
Make the code work by creating a new element with id wrapper that wraps the existing button element. Verify your solution by clicking the button. It should change its text.
Hint: you might have to use the following methods: querySelector, createElement, setAttribute, append */
<button type="button" id="button">Click Me</button>
